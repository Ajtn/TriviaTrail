# TriviaTrail

A simple trivia game based on a hex grid. Trivia is loaded from the-trivia-api.com, categories and grid size can be modified in settings. This project is largely to practice and improve my skills in React, Typescript, and CSS.

The original idea for the project was to use make a hexagonal grid with clip-path (CSS), this proved quite difficult to work with once text and multiple screen sizes were involved. The project then shifted to an entirely Canvas (HTML5/JS) based grid system. This meant additional work to be done to detect mouse location for clicks and any mouse over effects. It was a fun challenge to play with and my first experience with Canvas.
